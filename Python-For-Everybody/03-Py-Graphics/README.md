# Introduction to Graphics
- Graphics involve the representation and display of geometric shapes in two and three dimensions, as well as image processing

#### Turtle Graphics
- It provides a visual representation by moving a "turtle" around the screen to create drawings
- **Turtle State** : The position, heading (direction), pen color, and pen state (up or down)
- `setHeading(degrees)` 0(E), 90(N), 180(W), 270(S)

#### Basic Turtle Operations
1. **Moving the Turtle**
    - `forward(distance)`: Moves the turtle forward by the specified distance
    - `backward(distance)`: Moves the turtle backward by the specified distance
    - `left(angle)`: Turns the turtle left by the specified angle
    - `right(angle)`: Turns the turtle right by the specified angle
2. **Pen Control**
	- `penup()`: Lifts the pen so that moving the turtle does not draw a line
	- `pendown()`: Lowers the pen so that moving the turtle draws a line
	- `pencolor(color)`: Sets the color of the pen
	- `pensize(size)`: Sets the width of the pen
3. **Setting the Turtle's Attributes**
	- `shape(shape)`: Sets the shape of the turtle (e.g., "turtle", "arrow", "circle")
	- `speed(speed)`: Sets the speed of the turtle (1 to 10)
4. **Filling Shapes**
	- `begin_fill()`: Starts filling the shape
	- `end_fill()`: Ends filling the shape

#### Drawing Two-Dimensional Shapes
- eg : triangle.py
```python
import turtle

def draw_triangle(t, length):
    for _ in range(3):
        t.forward(length)
        t.left(120)

# Setup turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
draw_triangle(t, 100)
turtle.done()
```
#### Colors and the RGB System
- Colors in graphics are often represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) system, where each color component can range from 0 to 255

```python 
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.pencolor('red')  # Red
t.fillcolor('green')  # Green
t.begin_fill()
for _ in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)
t.end_fill()
turtle.done()
```

### Image Processing
- Involves capturing, representing, and manipulating images

- Rotate an image
- Convert an image from color to grayscale
- Apply color filtering to an image
- Highlight a particular area in an image
- Blur all or part of an image
- Sharpen all or part of an image
- Control the brightness of an image
- Perform edge detection on an image
- Enlarge or reduce an imageâ€™s size
- Apply color inversion to an image
- Morph an image

**Convert an image from color to grayscale**
```python
def grayscale(image):
    """Converts the argument image to grayscale."""
    for y in range(image.getHeight()):
        for x in range(image.getWidth()):
            (r, g, b) = image.getPixel(x, y)
            r = int(r * 0.299)
            g = int(g * 0.587)
            b = int(b * 0.114)
            lum = r + g + b
            image.setPixel(x, y, (lum, lum, lum))

# Test the function
from images import Image
image = Image("example.gif")
grayscale(image)
image.draw()
```
#### Image Methods
---
#### open()
```python
from PIL import Image
# from images import Image

# Open an image file
img = Image.open('example.jpg')
img.show()
```
#### Image(filename)
```python
from PIL import Image

# Open an image file
img = Image.open('example.jpg')
img.show()
```
#### getWidth() & getHeight()
```python
height = image.getHeight()
print(f"Height: {height}")

height = image.getHeight()
print(f"Height: {height}")
```
#### getPixel(x, y)
- Returns the RGB color value of the pixel at the specified (x, y) position
```python
pixel = image.getPixel(0, 0)
print(f"Pixel at (0, 0): {pixel}")
```
#### setPixel(x, y, (r, g, b))
- Sets the color of the pixel at the specified (x, y) position to the given RGB value
```python
image.setPixel(0, 0, (255, 0, 0))  
# Set the pixel at (0, 0) to red
image.draw()
```
#### draw()
- Displays the image
```python
image.draw()
```
#### save(filename)
```python
image.save("output.gif")
```
#### copy()
```python
image_copy = image.copy()
image_copy.draw()
```


### Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- GUIs allow users to interact with software through graphical elements like buttons, icons, and menus, rather than text commands

```python
import tkinter as tk

def on_click():
    print("Button clicked!")

root = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(root, text="Click Me", command=on_click)
button.pack()
root.mainloop()
```
